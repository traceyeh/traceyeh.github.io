                            <!--<p class="mb-0">I begin the process by conducting a series of listening exercises, applying reduced and causal listening to readily available transductions of technological events. Then, using Miyazaki and Howse’s Detektor, I record five sessions at the University of Victoria’s Humanities Computing and Media Centre, transducing EM waves of the network infrastructure of this environment. Using Oliveros’s deep listening method (2005), I investigate sonic events and rhythms, to understand network communications. Subsequently, I investigate the role of human and nonhuman communications in the events we hear. The sound files produced by this project form a corpus that represents algorithmic ecosystems whose presence is invisible. The listening approach is essential because it makes it possible to hear the specific events within networks along with their patterns, so as to make the observations necessary before working towards informed network stories.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">When networks communicate, they exchange commands and signals that could announce a network’s availability, establish a connection, or maintain a communication stream, among other functions. These events, when translated into sound through TNS, make for good material to understand how networks communicate variations between and across each other and corresponding devices. When people engage in a TNS exercise, where the subject of study may be a local network, they can listen for particular variations, all the while having the opportunity to interfere with active networks—by turning the Wi-Fi router off or even setting a phone on airplane mode, for instance. Within the time and space allocated to such an exercise, people are thus capable of listening intentionally and deeply for fluctuating volumes, frequencies, and rhythms.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">Transformation between media and the senses is key to a study of networks; it allows people to approach computation as well as time and space from technical and aesthetic perspectives. My research uses a multimodal approach to emphasize the material aspect of information exchange via wireless communications and to better understand and tell network stories. Listening to networks demonstrates that technologies are not as quiet, ephemeral, or immaterial as people may assume them to be. After all, networks adapt to the internal structures of individual technological devices, as well as overall and global network infrastructures, as they afford communication. In other words, the EM exchange that occurs between technologies as they communicate reflects the network protocols and algorithms that allow them to connect devices that do not necessarily share the same forms, platforms, functions, or even communication standards.</p>-->
                                <p class="mb-0">Using Miyazaki and Martin Howse’s Detektor, a <a href="https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2" target="_blank">Focusrite Scarlette 2i2</a> audio interface, and the <a href="https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/" target="_blank">Sonic Visualiser</a> software, I recorded five, approximately fifteen-minute-long sound clips at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/hcmc/index.php" target="_blank">Humanities Computing and Media Centre (HCMC)</a> in the McPherson Library building at the University of Victoria. I have received consent from the centre personnel, as well as ethics approval, to conduct and share these recordings. To maintain a semi-controlled environment, I recorded on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 1:00 pm to 1:15 pm, while situated in the same cubicle. The HCMC is an open-space computer lab, with twelve computer stations in its main area (ten Dell computers with UNIX operating system, and one Apple computer with an Apple operating system—iOS). These stations are occupied by a fluctuating number of research assistants and project primary investigators. The main area also has a table at its centre, where individuals work on their own laptops (that run on various operating systems). In another area, there are two Dell computers and two Apple computers, with Unix and Apple operating systems, respectively. The area in which I was situated at the time of the recordings has one Apple computer with an Apple operating system, in addition to a number of screens that could be connected to personal laptops via VGA or HDMI chords. The lab operates within the premises of the university library, and is therefore within the connection range of its Wi-Fi. Given the diversity of the HCMC environment, I was only able to record the number of people present at the time of each recording, allowing for the possibility of a person coming in or out (without being noticed or recorded as present). Further, I noted my own personal devices that I have running, in proximity to the Detektor, at the time of the recordings. For the purposes of this section, and given the lack of material for causal listening (as will be addressed below), I will present reduced listening descriptions of each session, and will then discuss causal listening collectively. Semantic listening remains completely outside of the scope of this section, given the complexities of the sounds recorded, and the—purely—assumptive narrative that such an analysis would risk attributing to the communications processes recorded and discussed. </p>
